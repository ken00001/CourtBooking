Basically it’s a booking system for Tennis Event I need. Main interface is scheduling grid where registered players can be booked.

Load is fairly light, max 10 concurrent users making bookings.

players there will be around 300.

will need to display their pic, additional information such as their match time, Nationality etc.

courts are many up to 21.

When clicking on booking available spot a panel will open up where players can be entered.

Like so

There are a number of other details, but this should give a decent overview.
Ability to search when players are booked is a must too. 
Also ability to quickly by first or last name find players is another must.

wo types of users Admin and Booker.
Admin can do more, block courts, assign them to be used for specific purpose only.

What do you think, is it something you feel comfortable taking on. Also is a choice of React.js and Mongo reasonable here?

Will probably need some sort of messaging too to keep all logged users in sync.
And deal with instances like two users competing for same spot etc..

Good reliablity?
As one of the pain points I need to guarantee no downtime on the app.
And have a solid DR plan.

Also any 3rd party components needed?

We want to make it visually attractive, while keeping it very responsive.

Good thing is the load will be light, only certain short bursts when 5,6 users will be entering bookings at the same time during 1hr period.

We can try to stay within the budget, but if we must will adjust it upwards.

Does timing required still looks to fall in about 3-4 weeks?
For the DB, I just set something up on AWS? MongoDB instance and start working on the schema and populating the data?

One question, how are we synchronizing data across users?

Messaging library?

See, at a peak 10 users can be making changes and they must see what others doing right away.

Polls from DB won't work.

I can look into this a bit too.

Mocks I send are good initial reference.

I can work on that as well. Challenge will be how to implement search functionality without cluttering interface too much.
It's something that will be used frequently and needs to be integrated.

But if we must separate panel is also workable.

Thinking we will also have super user in addition to admin.

See for the most part players data is static.

Only part changing is their reservations, tournament details when they play matches and status in the tournament.

There will need to be a way to update those fields, possibly via an API even.

Initially we can focus on booking functionality based on what is already in the database. Deal with updating player details later.

See the players will never book themselves.

Booker_1, Booker_2, etc or admins will be doing the bookings.

Players will just provide via phone info on when they need to play.
Then booker goes to the system, looks at what's available and books them

For synchronization I was thinking messaging library. Maybe Firebase is worth a look at, it's a real-time in memory database but proprietary to Google.
Possibly messaging that supports push notifications will be easier.\


Another important feature I forgot is marking if the app is Online or Offline.
Say network is down, there should be easy way to see it and become aware that other users will not see actions taken.

Maybe even we block UI when it happens.

Basically from 8am in the morning, with the last booking being evening time.

Like maybe 8 to 9pm.

Is that what you mean?

Then more in general tournaments run on specific days. Typically 2 or 3 weeks from Day 1 to say Day 21 that falls on specific calendar dates.


Looks like all the courts need to be made available for view.
Also at the top there should be indication if schedule is for Today with an easy switch to tomorrow.

Showing times on the left separately I don't know, the idea is to make it very easy to orient user. But I am not sure it's needed, and takes fair bit of real estate.

Good, for sure we can also discuss certain choices and figure out what works best.	

9/15
Having 5 Courts per screen listed is a good choice.
Here is the image how the timing is implemented on the left, that works fairly well.

Maybe good to keep name of the Courts always locked at the tope as the schedule scrolls down.
8:31 PM
I'll also provide more feedback on players search!!

what I did:

- user login/log out
- court panel design
- schedule & search part design
- some backend and DB development

On UI it’s good to expand the view to show all Courts. Maybe drop down to drive paging.
Displaying details for all potentially 4 players will be tricky too.


In most cases for two players there’s a lot of real estate in the panel. But with 4 it will get busier.

Positive we will figure it out.

Nothing major. Need to add flag based on nationality.

9/21
Múltiple other ways to tackle it.

There will also be special selections 

Looking, Hitting Partner, Coach

I’ll think about how to do this.

Sure thing. Displaying details for all players (potentially 4) will be tricky too.
But positive will figure out how to make it work.

On a panel we can also show right away two players drop downs, with toggle to show 4. Might be faster to add players then going one by one.

One by one works, just thinking might be slower.

Probably you can cache it on load.
From say Mongo DB or any cloud file store.
